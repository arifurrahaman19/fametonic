# Fametonic

Welcome to the Fametonic codebase! This project is built with Next.js (`15.4.6`) and uses modern tools like Tailwind CSS for styling and TypeScript for type safety.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized by feature and UI components. You’ll find reusable components in `src/components/ui`, layout elements in `src/layout`, and feature modules in `src/modules`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).
3. Start the development server with:
   - `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, `bun dev`)

Other useful commands:

- `npm run build` – Build the app for production
- `npm start` – Start the production server
- `npm run lint` – Check code quality

The main entry point is in `src/app/page.tsx`.
